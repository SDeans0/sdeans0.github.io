This isn't the first time I've thought about making a blog -
I'm probably not alone in having a few false starts on that front.

The core problem in starting a blog is to find something worth writing about,
and that someone else may gain some pleasure from reading. Previously I had
thought there would be some particular topic that I'd write about with authority;
something biological, or about the day-to-day practice of science. This aim was
the issue; there are plenty of good explanations of basic biological concepts
online, and it was unclear I would be adding. This time, I've decided to take
a broader and perhaps more humble view, and I intend to write some short
articles about (in roughly decreasing order of frequency):

- Things that I am interested in
- Things that I want to know about (and so research in a slightly more structured way)
- Things that I don't want to forget (e.g. how to quit vim)
- Things I have made (e.g. [Sam's Games Cupboard](https://gheoghst-game.herokuapp.com))

I'm not going to commit to a timetable, but I hope that this framing will help
motivate turning unstructured rumination into more coherent thoughts.
