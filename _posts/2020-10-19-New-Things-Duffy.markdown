It's always hard to admit that you're wrong about something.

It has been frequently said (perhaps to the point of being banal) that this
seems more true than ever right now, where the fever-pitch of social media
leaves little room for reflection or retreat from an extreme position. I think
that we would all be happier (if less ideologically satisfied) if we
reconsidered our opinions now and again, so here's a humble start on that road:
I've always been wrong about Carol Ann Duffy.

I always hated her fawning poems in the paper at the birth of a royal sproglet
or other such dull state occasion. I found them insipid. I thought that she
belonged to the wide class of things that people pretend to enjoy for the sake
of a cultural veneer rather than actual enjoyment. This was a mean-spirited view
of course; in my defence, I was a teenage boy.

As part of a general project to challenge my own assumptions about things I have
strong opinions on, I picked up The World's Wife from ebay. It's a collection of
poetic replies from the wives of fictional and historical men, and they are
everything that a poem about a royal baby could never be; funny, lyrical, bitingly
sarcastic.

So what was it that I didn't like in the first place? I went back and read a selection
of the poetry that I had disliked so much when I first read it. I still didn't
really enjoy it, despite appreciating the technical accomplishment more than in
my teens. Clearly the problem was not the poet, but the Poet Laureate; the sanitisation
of having an official post for art. When the state pays for art, even from an
accomplished artist, it can be little better than a ghastly Soviet mural.

Ultimately, it was worth the second chance. I often find myself suggesting to friends
who have dismissed favourite works of mine to reconsider; I thus have to hold myself
to the same standard, and this time I was pleasantly surprised. You still won't find
me dead with a book of Wordsworth, though.
