Not long ago, I took a walk in the [Cambridge Botanical Gardens] with my dad.
I have been back there a few times since being an undergraduate, and I see
quite a different side of the place now than then. As a plant science student, I had
a reasonable amount of teaching there, both in the greenhouses and out in the open garden –
I even had some rather sickly experimental plants of my own there in my final year.
Coming back after a few years I can enjoy it on a more aesthetic level, supplying
comments about plants I was taught about in a rate that I hope implies I could
tell you something almost any of them.

Two of my favourite specimens are next to one another at the end of Henderson's Walk,
the avenue of trees through the middle of the garden. They are, respectively, a
[Dawn Redwood] (_Metasequoia sp._) and a [Wollemi Pine] (_Wollemia nobilis_).
First known to academic botanists in the 20<sup>th</sup> century, both had been
previously assumed to be extinct from the fossil record. As such, they are both
known as '[living fossils]' - species which appear unchanged from ancient examples.

There is something amazing about the existence of living fossils. Morphologies[^1] which
were widespread in the past, and presumably well-adapted to those times, are intuitively
surprising to find in the present day; they violate a common assumption that evolution
means continuous change. There is something profound too about the feeling that
that the tree in front of you is indistinguishable from one strolled past by a dinosaur
millions of years ago.

The term 'living fossil', though, is misleading. It implies evolutionary stasis,
as though there is really nothing different between the trees at the end of the Main Walk
and some prehistoric forest. It is obvious from first principles that this cannot
be true; they live in profoundly different climates, and compete with profoundly
different species than their fossil doppelgängers – something must have changed
or they would not have survived. After all, other related species didn't, or we
wouldn't be surprised at finding these rare examples.

So our baseline assumption should be that these species are still changing and
adapting. Other than their looks, we have no particular reason to believe that they
are not. A [recent paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12133-5) addressed
this, albeit slightly obliquely. They sequenced a mighty 545 genomes from different
[_Ginkgo biloba_] specimens growing wild across China as well as cultivated plants
from abroad. Briefly, they found that the trees fell into four groups which have
been diverging from a common ancestor over the last 500,000 years, and that there
is evidence of continuing selection at sites across the whole genome. Far from 'fossils',
these plants are actively and continuously evolving.

Earlier, I said that living fossils violate a misplaced assumption that natural
selection means change, now I am telling you that they are, in fact,
continuously changing. Which is it?

The contradiction is resolved by considering the issue of resolution. When you look
at a fossil, there is necessarily less that you can measure about it, because you
only have its morphology, and usually only at a large scale. You can't tell, for
example, what compounds were made in ancient leaves to ward off herbivores or disease.
With the genome, we can get a picture of selection regardless of what it is actually
affecting in the biology of the organism. We can infer that some sort of change is
occurring, even if predicting what it actually is from the genes involved is beyond
our reach. There is plenty of change that can occur that is simply invisible.

As well as the principled argument against the 'living fossil' concept, there is
an empirical one – they often _don't_ resemble their ancestors that much anyway.
So far, we have considered two dynamics of evolution - 'change' and 'stasis'.
Underlying our assumption about 'change' is an implicit idea of progress - that
the divergence is in some way new. This doesn't have to be the case. A classic
example in plants comes from the [liverworts], moss-like plants which are often
described as 'basal' or in other derogatory terms which hint at their primitive
simplicity. Unlike other plants, which control gas exchange between their leaves
and the air using stomata which can open and close, liverworts have 8-cell holes
in their leaves[^2] which are permanently open. Standard botanical texts can hardly
contain their disgust at this primitive setup versus the elegance of 'higher' plant
stomata and their finely controlled opening. Until recently, it was assumed that
liverworts had split off from other plant lineages before the evolution of stomata,
but [more recent genomic research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982220304188)
indicates that they have been lost instead. The ancestor of liverworts, [hornworts]
and mosses would have had stomata, but for some reason liverworts have jettisoned
this structure during evolution. In this case, then, rather than representing an
earlier form, liverworts just represent their own idiosyncratic mode of plant
evolution, with the apparent ancient morphology being a red herring.

To my mind, the term 'living fossil' still has a place in communicating science
to the general public. Ultimately, it doesn't matter that much if most people don't
know about every detail of evolution, but it helps to give a more general view
of some different sorts of dynamics that are possible - change and stasis. I am
more concerned when I see the term crop up in the scientific literature, and
especially in textbooks at an undergraduate level. Evolution is complex, and a
more widespread respect for this would be good for research scientists and those
educated by them. Often in the scientific literature one encounters subjective terms
like 'basal' which are intended to imply that a particular disliked organism is more
primitive than a preferred organism. This is pure rhetoric, and does not do a service
to understanding evolution. 'Living fossil' is in the same category for me;
perhaps it is a useful for intuition, but it doesn't tell us about any fundamental
evolutionary process.

The Cambridge Botanical Gardens are currently curated by Prof. Beverly Glover,
an eminent evolutionary biologist, and I urge you (if you are able) to [visit].
They have installed a new
exhibit about plant evolution, with a [wooden walkway][rp] (I suppose they were jealous
of [Kew's]) which offers a wonderful view of the garden. Standing on it, looking back across
the [systematic beds][rp], with plants arranged by family, and the tree-flanked avenue planted
by Henslow, Darwin's mentor, I was struck by the thought
that the garden itself had something in common with its contents. Its broad arrangement
set down 180 years ago, with the embryonic evolutionary thinking of its founders,
remain basically unchanged. The detailed planting of each bed, and the information placed
unobtrusively around them, though, cement its relevance to 21<sup>st</sup> century science.
